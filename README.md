# Bayesian Optimization for Metallophotocatalysis Formulations

This repository is the source of the paper 'Closed-Loop Bayesian Optimization for Metallophotocatalysis Formulations'.

The Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian processes instance is created for the discovery of novel organic photo-catalysts 
and the reaction conditions.
